# Machine Learning Streamlit Application

This ***Machine Learning Streamlit Application*** allows users to select and train supervised machine learning models using a sample dataset or their own uploaded .csv file. Users can preview their dataset, experiment with hyperparameters, and view changes to their model performance metrics as they tune.<br><br>

This app includes the following machine learning models:
* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* K-Nearest Neighbors
* Decision Tree

My end objective is to give users the ability to quickly train machine learning models suitable for their various needs, all without having to write their own code.

## **Installation**

**Requirements:** <br>
This project is available on the Streamlit Community Cloud at [cozettebrown-machine-learning-app.streamlit.io](cozettebrown-machine-learning-app.streamlit.io)

To install **MLStreamlitApp**, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: **`git clone https://github.com/cozette-brown/BROWN-Data-Science-Portfolio/MLStreamlitApp.git`**
2. Navigate to the project directory: **`cd MLStreamlitApp`**
3. Install dependencies: **`pip install -r requirements.txt`**
4. Run the project: **`streamlit run main.py`**

## **Usage**

To use **MLStreamlitApp**, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Streamlit App:** Navigate to the MLStreamlitApp directory and run the project with **`streamlit run main.py`
2. **Upload or Select a Dataset** Select a sample dataset from sklearn.datasets or upload your own .csv file *(NOTE: At this time, the application only supports files which are already prepared for machine learning models. Please tidy and preprocess data before uploading.)*
3. **Select a Target Variable:** For sample datasets, there are already set 'target' variables, but in some cases you can choose a different variable.
4. **Select a Machine Learning Model:** Choose from Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, or Decision Tree. The application will warn you if the selected model is not appropriate for your selected sample dataset.
5. **Adjust Hyperparameters:** Adjust C for Logistic Regression; Number of Neighbors for K-Nearest Neighbors; and Max Depth, Minimum Samples Split, and Minimum Samples Leaf for Decision Tree.
6. **View Model Performance Metrics:** Analyze MSE, RMSE, and RÂ² Score for Linear Regression, or analyze Accuracy, Precision, Recall (Sensitivity), and F1-Score for other machine learning models. Each metric summary comes with a short guide to interpreting the results.

## Data

This project uses the following sample datasets from sklearn.datasets:
* Diabetes (regression)
* Breast Cancer Wisconsin (classification)
* Iris (classification)
* Wine (classification)
